This React Native code exhibits an uncommon error related to the interaction between `useEffect` and state updates within a functional component. The error manifests as an infinite loop, where the state continuously changes, leading to excessive re-renders and ultimately a crash or unresponsive app.  The root cause is improper dependency handling in `useEffect`, where a state variable that changes within the effect is also included in the dependency array. This creates a cyclical update where the effect triggers a state change, which then triggers the effect again, causing an infinite loop.
